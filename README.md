## Experiential Documentation From Developing with the Microsoft HoloLens 2

This document contains potential useful informaiton and tips for developing mixed reality applications for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 with the Unity game engine. This has been developed through experiential learning and is therefore for a compilation of Microsoft documentation and solutions to problems as relevant to the porjects in hand.
