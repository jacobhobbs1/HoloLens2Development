## Asynchronous APIs

- Async methods were built for processes that may take some time to complete and therefore need to run in parallel in the background while processes for things such as the UI continue to run as well. This stops longer processes from blocking up the thread and inhibiting the UX. 
- Overview explanation of asynchronous APIs in Microsoft documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/threading-async/call-asynchronous-apis-in-csharp-or-visual-basic).
